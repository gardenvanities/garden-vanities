# UI/UX Strategy Review

Use this workflow when you want high-quality recommendations for:

- page/flow redesign
- UX friction reduction
- feature ideation and prioritization
- conceptual product decisions

Primary skill: `.agent/skills/ui-ux-advisor/SKILL.md`

## Inputs

1. Scope (`page`, `flow`, `feature`, `problem statement`)
2. Goal (`engagement`, `readability`, `discovery`, `conversion`, etc.)
3. Constraints (`time`, `tech`, `design-system limits`)

## Steps

1. Frame the problem and user job
2. Audit IA + interaction + visual system fit
3. Identify top friction points
4. Generate candidate solutions
5. Rank options with explicit tradeoffs
6. Recommend phased execution plan

## Mandatory Output Format

1. `Problem framing`
2. `Best recommendation`
3. `Alternatives and tradeoffs`
4. `Impact (UX + technical)`
5. `Next steps`
6. `Applied rules`
7. `Residual risks`

## Validation Anchors

- Must respect `.agent/design-system.md`
- Must preserve light/dark parity
- Must not exceed depth `0..3`
- Must keep interactions accessible and measurable
