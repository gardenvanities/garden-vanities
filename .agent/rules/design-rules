# Design Tokens & Accessibility Rules

## 1. Design Tokens (No Magic Numbers)

To maintain visual consistency and support themes (Dark/Light), raw values are prohibited in components and CSS.

- **Colors**: NEVER use Hex, RGB, or HSL literals (e.g., `#ff0000`).
  - **Do**: Use Tailwind classes (`text-primary`, `bg-surface`) or CSS variables (`var(--color-text)`).
- **Spacing/Sizing**: NEVER use arbitrary pixel values (e.g., `padding: 13px`).
  - **Do**: Use the spacing scale (`p-4`, `m-2`) or variables (`var(--spacing-md)`).
- **Typography**: NEVER define `font-size` or `line-height` manually.
  - **Do**: Use typography tokens (`text-base`, `font-display`).
- **Exceptions**: Only allowed for unique, one-off decorative elements (like a specific complex animation or a legacy third-party library), and even then, should be documented.

## 2. Accessibility (a11y)

The Digital Garden must be usable by everyone. Svelte 5 will warn about many of these, but they must be strictly followed.

- **Semantic HTML**:
  - Use `<button>` for actions and `<a>` for navigation. NEVER use `onclick` on a `<div>` or `<span>` without ARIA roles and keyboard support.
  - Interactive elements MUST have a visible `:focus-visible` state.
- **Headings**:
  - Maintain a strict hierarchy. `<h1>` is reserved for the page title. Components should use `<h2>` through `<h6>`.
- **Images**:
  - Every `<img>` or Cloudinary wrapper MUST have an `alt` attribute. Use `alt=""` only for purely decorative images.
- **Contrast**:
  - Use token-based color combinations that are pre-verified for WCAG AA contrast compliance.
- **Forms**:
  - Every input MUST have a linked `<label>`.

## 3. Implementation Method

- **Tailwind-First**: Preference is given to Tailwind utility classes.
- **CSS Variables**: Use `@theme` blocks in Tailwind 4 to map project tokens to Tailwind utilities, ensuring that `bg-primary` automatically uses `var(--color-primary)`.
- **Transitions**: Every interactive state (hover, focus) should have a subtle transition (e.g., `transition-colors duration-200`) to improve perceived quality.
